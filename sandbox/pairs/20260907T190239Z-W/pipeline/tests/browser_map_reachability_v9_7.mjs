/* browser_map_reachability_v9_7.mjs — can a thumb actually reach MAP?
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH, measured on the served bytes 2026-09-05:
 * the architect reported "the map button doesn't work just tested on mobile".
 * It was not a broken link and it was not a race. Every one of the 7,680 rows
 * rendered a correct <a href> against the canonical receiver, with all five
 * contract parameters, and the deep-link contract resolved in 59 ms — 722 ms
 * before the project data finished. The link was perfect and it was DRAWN OFF
 * THE SIDE OF THE SCREEN.
 *
 * At a 389 px viewport the MAP anchor's left edge sat at x = 1217: 828 px past
 * the right edge of the viewport. document.elementFromPoint() at the anchor's
 * own centre returned null. Two served rules caused it, and neither is
 * sufficient alone — measured by ablation, pixels of the anchor off-screen:
 *
 *     as served .......................................... 828 px
 *     styles/v9-3.css  .tablewrap table{min-width:0} ..... 346 px
 *     styles/v9-6-1.css hide-mobile hidden ............... 799 px
 *     both together ....................................... 16 px
 *
 * WHY EVERY EXISTING CHECK PASSED. tests/browser_smoke_v9_6_1.mjs asserts the
 * mobile layout at 390 px and is green, because what it asserts is that all 11
 * columns are displayed and that the table is wider than its wrapper. It pins
 * the geometry that hides the button. A check can only fail on what it looks
 * at, and nothing in this estate had ever looked at where a control LANDS.
 * Desktop is genuinely fine — at 1707 px the anchor is on-screen — which is
 * why "verified on desktop" was true and useless.
 *
 * SO THIS PROOF ASSERTS POSITION, NOT STYLE. Not that a CSS string changed:
 * that the anchor's rectangle is inside the viewport, that a hit test at its
 * own centre returns the anchor itself, and that it is at least 44 x 44 px —
 * Apple's own minimum, against the 36 x 21 px measured on the served page.
 * A rule can be rewritten and still leave the control unreachable; only the
 * rectangle settles it.
 *
 * Run:  node tests/browser_map_reachability_v9_7.mjs
 *       (V9_BASE_URL to point it at a served origin instead of 127.0.0.1)

  /* This asserted `=== 7680` rendered rows within 60 s. Two faults, both found
     by an independent review on 2026-09-05:

     It measured the wrong property. The defect was that a stalled request on a
     SECOND ORIGIN left the reader looking at nothing; what must be true is that
     the table becomes USABLE without that request, and the first rows are what
     make it usable. Pinning the DOM to 7,680 rows also pins the page to
     rendering all of them - the very thing that builds 323,802 elements and an
     800,000-pixel document. Correct pagination would have turned this proof
     red, so the proof was defending the performance defect.

     And 60 s is not a budget, it is a surrender. A reader who waits 60 s has
     already gone. FIRST_ROWS_BUDGET_MS is a stated number that can be argued
     with, which "eventually" never is.

     The dataset's completeness is a different property from the DOM's, and it
     is asserted separately below against the page's own record count - so this
