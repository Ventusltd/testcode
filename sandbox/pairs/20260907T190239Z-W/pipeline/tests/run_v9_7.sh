# WHAT V9.7 CHANGES FROM ITS FROZEN PARENT, NAMED ONE FILE AT A TIME.
#
# This was `diff -qr "$V962/styles" "$V97/styles"` and a five-entry script
# list, and by 202609050415 it was already failing: the deep-link work of that
# night had edited styles/v9-6-1.css and scripts/plugins/projects-v9-5-1.js in
# place, so the whole-directory diff went red and nothing in the estate runs
# this script often enough to notice. A gate that is red and unread is not a
# gate. So the divergence is DECLARED rather than the check deleted: every file
# below still has to be byte-identical to v9.6.2, and the three that are
# deliberately not are listed with the reason, which is the part a reader needs.
#
# Adding a file to CHANGED_FROM_PARENT is a governed act. It is the sentence
# "this release owns this file now", and it must be true.
CHANGED_FROM_PARENT=(
  # 202609061329 - the seven columns hidden below 768 px come back. The
  # override V9.6.1 wrote had survived only as a comment since 202609051100;
  # measured on the parent at 393 px: COUNTY, OPERATOR, REPD REF, GLOBALGRID
  # REF and REPD UPDATED all display:none. They scroll inside .tablewrap now.
  styles/v9-6-1.css
  # 202609061329 - the release states its own identity.
  index.html
  # 202609061329 - the smoke asserts the columns at phone width and fires the
  # engine on MAP hrefs taken from the table itself, not typed in.

  # 202609061329 - the reachability gate carried the same five-hidden check;
